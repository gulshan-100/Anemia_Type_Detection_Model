# Anemia_Type_Detection_Model
It is a ML model which detect the class of anemia in a patient based on patient's data.

## Overview
Anemia is a condition characterized by a deficiency of red blood cells or hemoglobin in the blood, resulting in reduced oxygen transport to tissues. There are several types of anemia, each with different causes and characteristics. This machine learning model aims to classify the type of anemia based on blood test results, helping healthcare professionals make accurate diagnoses and treatment decisions.

## Classes of Anemia this model can detect
1. Healthy
2. Normocytic hypochromic anemia
3. Iron deficiency anemia
4. Leukemia
